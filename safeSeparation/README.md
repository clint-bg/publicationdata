# Explosives Safety Separation Distances (ESSD)
Safe manufacturing and staging of energetic substances and articles requires stand-off distances to reduce the severity of the effects in an ignition scenario. 
The United States Department of Defense has specified those stand-off distances in the Defense Explosives Safety Regulation 6055.09 (DESR). 
Within that document are stand-off guidelines for the different divisions of energetics such as hazard division (HD) 1.3 which are substances and articles that 
primarily burn or deflagrate. The stand-off distance to an inhabited building is the distance required to protect structures occupied by people both inside and 
outside Department of Defense property lines. Protection is for blast pressures and effects, debris or fragments, and thermal hazards.

Multiple references have been compiled to estimate the ESSD for open or unconfined burning events of propellants. There are also several references of 
confined scenarios where the gases do not easily escape and the internal pressure can build up possibly resulting in a pressure burst. The csv files contain the test 
and modeling data used in the Jupyter notebook to calculate and plot the ESSD. The Jupyter notebook has the analysis, figures, and tables.
